# Technical Data

Almost all code is written in C++. You can run the code by simply starting
`make all`. Output data can be generated using `make data` while
visualizations can be generated by `make visualizations`. We also have a
grader that computes the score of submissions. To run it first create the
output files (for instance by `make data`), then call `make grades.html` and
open the resulting HTML file in a browser. More commands can be found in the
`Makefile`.

Most code is written during the 6.5 hours of the contest and therefore not
optimized.
